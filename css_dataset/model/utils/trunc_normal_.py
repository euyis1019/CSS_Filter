    r"""Fills the input Tensor with values drawn from a truncated
    normal distribution. The values are effectively drawn from the
    normal distribution :math:`\mathcal{N}(\text{mean}, \text{std}^2)`
    with values outside :math:`[a, b]` redrawn until they are within
    the bounds. The method used for generating the random values works
    best when :math:`a \leq \text{mean} \leq b`.

    NOTE: this impl is similar to the PyTorch trunc_normal_, the bounds [a, b] are
    applied while sampling the normal with mean/std applied, therefore a, b args
    should be adjusted to match the range of mean, std args.

    Args:
        tensor: an n-dimensional `torch.Tensor`
        mean: the mean of the normal distribution
        std: the standard deviation of the normal distribution
        a: the minimum cutoff value
        b: the maximum cutoff value
    Examples:
        >>> w = torch.empty(3, 5)
        >>> nn.init.trunc_normal_(w)
